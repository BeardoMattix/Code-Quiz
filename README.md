## Motivation

I wanted to create a project that utilizes the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills I have learned up to this point. I also wanted to create a web application that is interactive and fun for the user.

The quiz asks users questions about basic JavaScript functionality and increments and decrements the score based on correct and incorrect answers. The quiz also has a timer witch will decrement 10 secods after each incorrect answer and will end the game when the timer reaches zero, regardless of the user's progress in the quiz.

Once the user has completes the quiz, they can save their score to the leaderboard and see how they stack up against other users.

#### Technologies
* HTML
* CSS 
* JavaScript
